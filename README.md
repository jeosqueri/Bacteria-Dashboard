# Plotly Homework: Belly Button Diversity

*This project is currently being worked on*

Overview
----
For this assignment, I was tasked with building an interactive dashboard to explore a dataset of belly button biodiversity, which catalogs the microbes found in human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called **operational taxonomic units, or OTUs,** in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Using Plotly, I was tasked with creating multiple charts and visualizations to display the data for each subject. A dropdown menu was created so users can navigate through the different subjects data by selecting their subject ID and having the dashboard display that subjects data. The dashboard allows the users to see the subjects top 10 OTUs found present in their navels, a bubble cha
